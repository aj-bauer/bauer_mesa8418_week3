# TO-DO List 

Here are a list of possible next steps to perform using this data and project:

* Find a method to visualize total population as well as the percent of the population
  below the poverty line for each neighborhood; one method might be to use hue or 
  intensity of color to represent total population; another might be to plot the
  total number of individuals below the poverty line by neighborhood, with hue
  representing the percent total.
* Create a visualization to represent the distribution of levels of education (as
  percent/fraction of the total pop) by neighborhood. This might work well as a 
  stacked bar chart.
* Create a visualization showing the distribution of age groups within the sub-
  population of people below the poverty line within each neighborhood. This might
  also work well as a stacked bar chart.
* Find historical data to observe the change in percent of the population below
 the poverty line over the past 5-10 years, again by neighborhood, this time
 as a line graph.
